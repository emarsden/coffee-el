# coffee.el -- Submit a BREW request to an RFC2324-compliant coffee device

This Emacs Lisp library allows Emacs users to submit a BREW request to an RFC2324-compliant coffee
device (implementing the Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol, or HTCPCP). It prompts the user for
the different additives, then issues a HTCPCP BREW request to the coffee device. 

You can probably guess how coffee.el came about …yadda yadda everything but make coffee …yadda
yadda…

coffee.el requires a special BREW-capable version of Emacs/W3 to be installed.
